>**This Module requires that you connect your account in the `Linked accounts` page. Go to Settings to get this done.**

The `Gmail Sender` module allows you to finalize a workflow with an email that can be send from your Gmail address. 

**This is particularly useful when you want to automate email outreach or receive / send reports (e.g. News reports / Competitor reports / Operational reports).**

The `Gmail Sender` module has **three inputs**:

- **Input**: Can receive multiple inputs of type `text`. The `recipient` represents the email or emails (if it is a list) that you want to send the email to. The `title` represents the subject of the email and the `body` represents the body of the email.
- **Config**: If the `draft` button is enabled, emails are kept as draft in yout inbox
