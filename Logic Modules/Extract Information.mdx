The `Extract Information` module is a logic module that can be used to exctract important information from a block of text. This module is particularly useful when extracting key variables from a text to store into a spreadsheet or database

**You can use this module to parse a complex output and extract relevant information for the workflow**

The `Extract Information` module has **one input** and **variable outputs**:

- **Input**: `text`, receives any text input
- **Output**: `Text`, can have unlimited text outputs, each output requires a proper description as those are leverage by the AI agent to find the right information.

In this module, you can also use `Advanced Options` to select the AI model you want to use. Please find here a comparison of the models we provide: [Model Comparison](/content/text)

In the image below, the input is being parsed into 2 outputs: Name and age
